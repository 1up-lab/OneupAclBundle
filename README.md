OneupAclBundle
==============

The OneupAclBundle provides easy to use Acl features for your Symfony2 application. It is built on top of the Security component and comes with
handy features including:

* an [Acl manager](https://github.com/1up-lab/OneupAclBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/manager.md), your entry point.
* [Doctrine listeners](https://github.com/1up-lab/OneupAclBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/doctrine.md) for automatically remove Acl entries once an entity is deleted.
* [Check request parameters](https://github.com/1up-lab/OneupAclBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/controller.md) against your access control lists.
